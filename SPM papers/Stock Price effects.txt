January effect, Turn of the month effect and Day of the week effect or Monday effect, Holiday effect 


Why do stocks drop on holidays?
The theory behind this effect is that traders are lightening up their holdings (selling) prior to the three day holiday in order to avoid any unexpected bad news. The selling pressure drives stock prices down, making those days a good opportunity for buying lower in the range.
