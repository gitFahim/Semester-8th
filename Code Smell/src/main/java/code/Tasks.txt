Main Tasks:

1. Textual Content Extractor
2. Information Retrieval Normalization Process
3. Smell Detector

1. Textual Content Extractor:

    i. Zip file open
    ii. Method extract

2. IR Normalization Process

    I.  separating composed identifiers using the camel case splitting which splits words based on underscores, capital letters and numerical digits;
    Ii.  reducing to lower case letters of extracted words;
    Iii.  removing special characters, programming keywords and common English stop
    words;
    Iv.  stemming words to their original roots via Porterâ€™s stemmer [51].

    Finally, the normalized words are weighted using the term frequency - inverse document frequency (tfidf ) schema [50], which reduces the relevance of too generic words that are contained in most source components.

3.Smell Detector

    i) The detector relies on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), an extension of the Vector Space Model.Which models code components as vectors of terms occurring in a given system.
    LSI uses singular value decomposition (SVD).
